# Run the code. 

To run the code, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go run hello-world.go
```

Go requires a package name in every .go file. So, we will create a new file called `main.go`. This acts as the entry point for our program.

While this is not a module but we still need to follow a package and main function pattern.
