# Go Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Go Learning Repository**!

This repository is designed to document my journey of learning the Go programming language (Golang). It contains code snippets, exercises, projects, and notes that cover various aspects of Go, ranging from the basics to advanced concepts.

---

## 📚 **What You'll Find Here**

- **Basics** – Variables, constants, control flow, and functions.
- **Data Structures** – Arrays, slices, maps, and structs.
- **Concurrency** – Goroutines, channels, and the `sync` package.
- **Error Handling** – Idiomatic error patterns and custom errors.
- **Modules & Packages** – Creating and managing Go modules.
- **Projects** – Small projects to solidify concepts.
- **Testing** – Unit testing with `testing` package and benchmarks.
- **Advanced Topics** – Interfaces, reflection, generics, and Go internals.

## 🛠 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

To run the examples in this repository, make sure you have:

- **Go (1.22 or later)** – [Download here](https://go.dev/dl/)
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Basic knowledge of programming fundamentals (helpful but not mandatory).

---

### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/go-learning.git
cd go-learning
```

### **Run a Go File**

```bash
go run <file-name>.go
```

## 🚀 **Goals**

- Learn Go by writing code, not just reading.
- Build small projects to understand real-world use cases.
- Explore Go's unique features like concurrency and memory management.
- Document learning progress for future reference.

## 🧪 **Testing**

Run tests with:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Add `-v` for verbose output:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```
