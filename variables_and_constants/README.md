# Variables and Constants in Go

This module demonstrates the basics of variables, constants, and variable scoping in Go. It contains example functions that illustrate how to declare, initialize, and use variables and constants, as well as how variable scope works in Go programs.

## Contents

- `main.go`  
  Entry point for the module. Calls the demonstration functions.

- `variables-and-constants.go`  
  Shows different ways to declare and use variables and constants, including:
  - Simple variable declaration
  - Short variable declaration
  - Multiple variable declaration
  - Constant declaration (typed, untyped, block, and using `iota`)

- `variable-scoping.go`  
  Explains variable scope in Go:
  - Global scope
  - Function scope
  - Block scope

## How to Run

Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.22 or later recommended).

From the `variables_and_constants` directory, run:

```sh
go run .
